# Stammbaum

A pocket "who is who" for family gatherings. Built mobile first — the phone in
your pocket at the party is the primary target, the desktop layout is the
enhancement. Two screens, one markdown file:

- **Übersicht** — the whole tree as a map you drag, pinch and flick around.
- **Person** — one person with their first-degree relatives only: parents on
  top, partners beside (below, on a phone), children underneath.

The data lives in [`data/family.md`](data/family.md) and is written in a
mermaid-flavoured DSL, so the tree is edited like text and reviewed like code.

## Gestures

The overview has no zoom buttons; it is driven by gestures, the same ones a map
app uses.

| Gesture | |
| --- | --- |
| Drag / flick | Pan, with momentum afterwards |
| Two-finger pinch | Zoom, around the point between your fingers |
| Double-tap | Zoom in at that point; again when zoomed in, back out |
| Tap a bubble | Open that person |
| Mouse wheel, trackpad pinch | Zoom at the cursor |
| Arrow keys, `+` / `-`, Enter | The same, from the keyboard |

The tree is clamped so it can never be flung off screen, and the button in the
bottom corner zooms out to the whole family.

## Running it

```sh
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
npm test             # parser, graph and layout tests
npm run build        # dist/ — a normal static site
npm run build:single # dist/index.html — ONE self-contained file, works offline
```

`build:single` inlines the script, the styles and every photo as `data:` URIs.
The result is a single HTML file you can mail to relatives or open from a USB
stick with no server and no network — which is usually what a family gathering
in a house with bad reception actually needs.

## Writing the family file

Everything the app shows comes from the ```` ```family ```` block(s) in
`data/family.md`. Prose outside those blocks is ignored, so document the family
in the same file.

```family
person heinrich  "Heinrich Bauer"  born=1931-04-02 died=2011-08-17 photo=heinrich.jpg
person elisabeth "Elisabeth Bauer" born=1934-11-23 maiden=Vogt nick=Oma

heinrich + elisabeth married=1956-05-19 -> klaus, brigitte

%% Divorced, then married again: two partnerships, one line each.
klaus + sabine married=1984 divorced=1996 -> nina, jonas
klaus + carmen married=2001 -> luca

%% Not married, just a couple — and one that ended without a divorce.
brigitte + tobias together=2015 -> emil
nina + david together=2012 separated=2018
```

| Statement | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `person <id> "<Name>" key=value …` | Declares a person. |
| `<a> + <b> key=value …` | A partnership. |
| `<a> + <b> -> <child>, <child>` | Children of that partnership. |
| `<a> -> <child>` | Children whose second parent is unknown. |
| `me <id>` | Whose point of view relations are named from. |
| `%% …` | Comment. |

**Person keys** — `born`, `died`, `photo`, `maiden`, `nick`, `note`, `sex`.
**Partnership keys** — `married`, `divorced`, `together`, `separated`,
`children`.

Notes:

- A partnership has a start — `married` or `together` — and an optional end —
  `divorced` or `separated`. That gives four states: *verheiratet*, *zusammen*,
  *geschieden*, *getrennt*. A bare `a + b` with no keys counts as a marriage.
  In the tree a marriage carries the two rings its children hang from, an
  unmarried couple gets the plain line, and a partnership that ended is dotted.
- Use `together` for a couple who are not married.
- A date you do not know or do not care to publish can be written as `?` or
  `true` — `a + b together=?`, `a + b divorced=true`. The partnership is drawn
  as that kind of partnership, just without a year next to it.
- Dates are free text, but `1956`, `1956-04` and `1956-04-02` are formatted
  nicely (`* 2. April 1956`); anything else is printed as written.
- Ids are the deep-link handles — `#/p/klaus` opens Klaus directly — so keep
  them short, lowercase and stable.
- `nick` wins over the first name in bubbles: the tree says *Oma*, the detail
  view says *Elisabeth Bauer*.
- With a `me <id>` line, every person in the detail view is captioned with what
  they are to that person: *Tante*, *Cousine 2. Grades*, *Schwager*, *Mann der
  Cousine*. `sex=m` or `sex=f` (`w` works too) picks the gendered word; without
  it the caption names both (*Onkel/Tante*). People who are neither blood
  relatives nor one partnership away from one get no caption.
- Statements about one partnership may be split across lines and written in
  either partner order; they merge.
- Photos are file names inside [`data/photos/`](data/photos). Anyone without a
  photo gets an initials bubble in a colour derived from their id.
- Undeclared ids still render, and the app shows a dismissible list of hints
  about the file — a half-finished tree never breaks the page.

## Appearance

The button in the app bar cycles **Automatisch → Hell → Dunkel**, and the choice
is remembered. "Automatisch" follows the phone's own light/dark setting and
switches with it; the two explicit modes override it. The phone's status bar
colour follows along.

The switching is daisyUI's, not hand-rolled:

```css
@plugin "daisyui" {
  themes: light --default, dark --prefersdark;
}
```

`--prefersdark` is what makes the dark theme apply on its own under
`prefers-color-scheme: dark`; setting `data-theme="light"` or `"dark"` on
`<html>` overrides it. Adding another daisyUI theme — or a custom one — is a
matter of putting its name in that list.

Everything in [`src/styles/app.css`](src/styles/app.css) is written against
daisyUI's semantic variables (`--color-base-100…300`, `--color-base-content`,
`--color-primary`, `--color-error`, `--radius-*`), so both themes are handled by
the same rules and nothing carries a hardcoded colour. The per-person avatar
tint is mixed into the current surface rather than picked per theme:

```css
fill: color-mix(in oklab, hsl(var(--avatar-h) 70% 55%) 26%, var(--color-base-100));
```

which is why the bubbles are pale in light mode and deep in dark mode without a
second palette existing anywhere.

## How it is built

Vite + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS 4 and daisyUI 5 for the styling and the
theme system; no UI framework and no runtime JavaScript dependencies. Tailwind
and daisyUI are build-time only, so the offline file still fetches nothing —
about 36 kB of JavaScript and 62 kB of CSS, both tree-shaken to what the app
actually uses. Icons are inline SVG, so there is no icon font either.

The overview is one SVG with a transform for pan and zoom, driven by Pointer
Events so mouse, trackpad, pen and touch all take the same code path. The person
view is HTML with connectors drawn into an SVG overlay after layout, so it
reflows correctly from a 390 px phone up. daisyUI supplies the chrome — navbar,
buttons, card, badges, menu — while the tree and the person view keep their own
component classes, because utility strings inside generated SVG would be
unreadable.

```
data/family.md          the family, and the format documented in prose
data/photos/            photos, inlined by the offline build
src/parser/             markdown → { people, unions, warnings }
src/family.ts           derived lookups: parents, partnerships, broods, search
src/layout/layout.ts    generations, tidy horizontal placement, refinement sweep
src/ui/icons.ts         inline stroked SVG icons
src/views/overview.ts   the gesture-driven SVG tree
src/views/person.ts     one person and their first-degree relatives
src/styles/app.css      Tailwind + daisyUI setup and every component rule
tests/                  parser, family and layout tests (vitest)
```

The layout is a two-stage tidy tree: a recursive walk places each couple above
the middle of its children, then a relaxation sweep pulls couples towards their
children and children towards their parents without ever reordering a row. Two
families that marry into each other end up next to each other instead of at
opposite ends of the page.
